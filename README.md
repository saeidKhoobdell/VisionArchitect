## VisionArchitect

Welcome to VisionArchitect, a repository dedicated to crafting and testing the best vision architectures using Keras and PyTorch. Here, you'll find a collection of Jupyter Notebooks focusing on various computer vision models, along with sample images for testing purposes.

## About

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a platform for experimenting with and evaluating different vision architectures. Whether you're interested in exploring classic models like LeNet and AlexNet or leveraging pre-trained networks for your projects, VisionArchitect offers a range of resources to support your journey in computer vision.

## Contents

- `imageNetClasses.json`: JSON file containing the classes from the ImageNet dataset.
- `letNetAndAlexNetWithKeras.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the implementation of LeNet and AlexNet using Keras.
- `PretrainNetworkPytorch.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook showcasing the usage of pre-trained networks in PyTorch.
- `rankNAccuracyPytorch.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for evaluating the accuracy of ranking in PyTorch.
